## Demo Conversation Example

### User:
I want to return my product.

### AI Response:
You can request a return within 7 days of delivery. Go to Orders → Select product → Click "Return".
If you need help, I can escalate this to a human support agent.

### User:
Where is my order? It has not arrived yet.

### AI Response:
Sorry for the delay! Please share your order number so I can check the delivery status for you.
If needed, I will escalate the request to our support team.

### User:
How do I reset my password?

### AI Response:
Click on "Forgot Password" on the login page. You will receive a reset link by email.
